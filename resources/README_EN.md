## UNRandom

UNRandom is a fair random-selection application for classrooms, teams, events, decision-making, and other scenarios.

## Features

### Draw workflows

- **Roll call**: Supports standard random, history-balanced, and repeat-control draws.
- **Quick draw**: Quickly draws students through a standalone floating window.
- **Rich presentation**: Provides unified settings for animation, results, speech, music, and notifications, with fallback when a notification fails.

### Fairness and list management

- Dynamically adjusts weights using history count, draw interval, group, gender, and other factors to reduce repeats and distribution imbalance.
- Uses stable internal identifiers to preserve history; student numbers, IDs, and names are display information only.
- Supports multiple student lists, prize pools, and `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` import, mapping, and preview.
- Saves history for every draw round for convenient review.

### Reviewable draw results

- Every draw automatically saves a proof record file.
- You can choose to involve the server in and witness the draw process.
- Draw results can be checked again through official channels.

### Data, privacy, and security

- Settings, lists, and history can all be imported, exported, backed up, and restored.
- Backups may include lists, history, draw proofs, images, and audio, but never passwords or other security information.
- Password, TOTP, or USB-drive protection can secure important operations, and you can choose which operations require verification.

### Verification boundaries

| Mode | What it can do | What it cannot prove |
|---|---|---|
| Offline proof | Review a completed draw process | It is not a pre-draw server witness; it cannot prove that the local program or real-world roster was not modified |
| Online witnessing | Protect the draw flow after the server locks it | It cannot prove that the roster is authentic, complete, or unfiltered before submission |

## Technical evolution

| Version | Stack | Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | Python + PyQt5 + qfluentwidgets | First desktop implementation |
| v2 | Python + PySide6 + qfluentwidgets | Qt stack evolution |
| **v3** | **C# + Avalonia + FluentAvalonia** | .NET desktop rewrite for continued draw, verification, and desktop-integration development |

## Download and updates

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SECTL/SecRandom/releases) provides release packages and change notes.
- The [official download page](https://stk.sectl.cn/SecRandom) provides the latest download entry point.
- Automatic updates validate a signed release manifest and artifact length/hash before deployment. Refer to the package and notes supplied with each release for installation details.

## License and third-party notices

- SecRandom is released under [GNU GPLv3](../LICENSE).
- See [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) for third-party components, copyright information, and distribution-review notes.
- History-balanced weights and candidate filters help reduce repeat selections and improve long-term distribution. They do not replace management of real-world rosters, rules, or processes, and SecRandom does not claim to verify those conditions.
